# decentralised-streaming
As a consumer of video and streams and someone who knows how expensive computer resources I think it would be the greatest to have a video and stream shareing service that was entirely controled by the artest. I am also aware networks are the most important thing for getting your stuff out there so there must be few places for content with many ways of distributing it. This is my solution.
